VoxLib demo for Irix 5.2

	This distribution contains the following directories:

	/heart   - the hogheart CT dataset
	/voxlib  - a demo version of the voxlib library
	/iblast  - a command line library excercising program
	/vblast  - an IrisGL demo using the library

	The copy of voxlib is locked to the same lock ID as Voxblast. 
A lockfile "IAF2" is included.  You may place it in /usr/local/locks or
set the environmental variable IAF_LOCKFILE to the name of the file.  The
only difference between this library and a full release is that the
renderer will attempt to check the Voxblast lock ID before the first
rendering is performed.  It is recommended that the demo programs and
Voxblast be used together to get an idea of the many innovative ways the
software based hardware independant volume rendering library may be used.

	The libraries are the same on all supported platforms, but the 
IrisGL demo is only available on the SGI platform.  Sample Makefiles are
included with the demo programs and pre-compiled binaries of each program
are included as well.  See the README files in each demo program subdirectory.
