Iblast voxlib demo program

	This program is a general library exercising utility.  It is
command line based with no graphical display.  It allows the user to
render and save images to disk as well as script simple animations.

Notes:
	The palette and opacity files are in the same format as their
Voxblast equivalents.  The data volumes must be in 8bit raw headerless
one slice per file (old style Voxblast ".fb" format).  This program uses
the older style vl_render call (opposed to the vl_m_render multi-cpu call
and the output image MUST be large enough to store the entire volume
rendered at any angle (ie vl_render does not clip to the output buffer
bounds, vl_m_render does).  Thus, if one loads a "512x512x512" dataset
(diagonal = 890) one MUST also issue an "image 890 890" command as well
to guarantee the output image bounds are large enough to hold the             
rendering at any angle.
	Most commands are simple wrappers around individual voxlib calls.
See the source in cmdline.c and the voxlib SDD for details on each call.

Example usage:

% cd heart                              cd to the data directory
% ../iblast/iblast                      Start the program
