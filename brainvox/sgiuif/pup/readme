this is an implementation of an SGI dopup() compatible popup menu library.
for the most part it looks and feels like the standard gl/4Sight menu
but is written entirely in gl and has a few handy improvements that
I felt were desirable:

	optional ``state'' markers on menu items so you can use
	the same menu item to turn off and on some feature in your
	program and get a visual cue as to whether it is off or on.

	radio menu items - the ability to group a set of related
	but mutually exclusive menu items with a ``state'' marker to
	indicate which one is currently active.  (similar to radio buttons
	in various tool kits).  there can be more than one such group
	per menu (max 10).

	you can specify which button the menu is used with (i.e.
	LEFTMOUSE, MIDDLEMOUSE or RIGHTMOUSE).

	you can turn on an option to make the menu save which item
	was selected last and draw the menu with that item positioned
	under the cursor the next time the menu is drawn.

	you can call a routine to change a single menu item in
	an existing menu.

the remainder of the menu is plug compatible with the default gl library
(i.e. includes addtopup(), defpup(), newpup(), freepup(), dopup(), newpup() &
setpup()) and it completely replaces the SGI pup implementation (i.e. I use
the same routine names).  A caveat is that the FORTRAN binding is present,
but not quite correct (who writes graphics programs in FORTRAN anyway :-)  A
lesser caveat is that appearance-wise it is not a perfect imitation of the
sgi pup, but its close enough.
