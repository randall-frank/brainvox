Configuring and Compiling AIR 5.0

*	UNIX (including Linux and Mac OS X) 
*	PC (DOS, Windows and Windows NT) 
*	Configuring the src/config.h file


UNIX (including Linux and Mac OS X)

1.

In the main AIR directory, type './configure'. This will execute a shell
script that should automatically create three files. The first of these
will be in the main AIR directory and is called 'Makefile'. The other
two will be in the src/ subdirectory and are called 'Makefile' and
'config.h'. If ./configure fails, it should print out some insight into
the problem that you may be able to fix. Alternatively, you might
consider some of the workarounds listed below If you troubleshoot
./configure, you sometimes need to remove ./configure.cache to get
./configure to forget results of earlier runs Caution To Developers: the
Makefiles that are generated do not contain the level of dependency
information needed for efficient software development. For example,
changes to a subroutine in the src subdirectory will not cause all main
programs that use that subroutine to be rebuilt without any unnecessary
rebuilds of other routines. Developers should consider building a shared
library from the src directory subroutines and linking to this shared
library as a strategy for shifting such dependencies to runtime.


2.

In the src/ subdirectory, edit the 'config.h' file to meet any site
specific preferences. Any text editor can be used (be sure to save any
changes as plain text), configuration details are provided below.


3.

Optionally, review and edit the two files called 'Makefile' Experts may
elect to override default optimization levels, etc.


4.

In the main AIR directory, type 'make all'. This should compile the code


5.

If you want the compiled programs moved to the bin subdirectory, type
'make install' in the main AIR directory If you ultimately want the
programs somewhere else entirely, it is much easier to copy them from
/bin, so type 'make install' to move them to /bin first


6.

Before rebuilding AIR (e.g., after changing something in src/config.h)
you must type 'make clean' in the main AIR directory before typing 'make
all' again 'make clean' removes all of the compiled libraries and
programs so that new, internally consistent versions can be built


7.

To start over from the beginning at any point, type 'make distclean' in
the main AIR directory and return to step 1 'make distclean' removes all
of the compiled libraries and programs as well as the configuration
information and Makefiles




Workarounds:

1.

If the ./configure script fails and you cannot get it to run correctly,
you can simply create a file called src/config.h and copy any
configuration lines that you feel are appropriate into it (an empty file
called src/config.h is acceptable if you want to use all the default
configurations in the AIR.h file) In this case, you will need to execute
the MAKE.com file as described next rather than running 'make'


2.	If the command 'make all' fails, (e.g., if you don't have the
executable called 'make'), you can type 'sh MAKE.com' or 'sh MAKE.com
bin' (the latter command will install the programs in the bin
subdirectory) from the main AIR directory to compile the code. 3.	It
is also possible to configure AIR manually in the AIR.h file as in older
versions of AIR, but this should not generally be necessary.


PC (DOS, Windows and Windows NT) Please note that different PC compilers
have different requirements and only general recommendations are
provided here.

1.	In the src subdirectory, copy the file 'config_PC.h' to 'config.h'
2.

Edit the 'config.h' file to meet any site specific preferences Any plain
text editor can be used, configuration details are provided below.


3.

In the main AIR directory, edit the files AIRmain.h and HEADERmain.h,
removing the lines with UNIX style forward slashes and uncommenting the
lines with the PC style backslashes After modification, AIRmain.h should
read: #include "src\\AIR.h" After modification, HEADERmain.h should
read: #include "src\\HEADER.h" There should not be any spaces or tabs
before '#include' in either of these files


4.

Using your PC C compiler, compile all of the files in the src
subdirctory into a library Consult your C compiler documentation for
details


5.

Using your PC C compiler, compile each of the programs in the main AIR
directory. For example, compile the file 'alignlinear.c' to generate the
executable file 'alignlinear.exe'. You will need to link in the library
compiled in the previous step. Consult your C compiler documentation for
details Note that the files src/AIR.h, src/config.h and src/HEADER.h are
required when compiling each of the programs in the main directory.




Configuring the src/config.h file The following lines shown in green can
be included or altered in config.h to provide site specific information:
Omitting these lines causes their default values (defined in the AIR.h
file) to be used.

#define AIR_CONFIG_AUTO_BYTESWAP 0 

If non-zero, AIR will attempt to
detect image files (.hdr and .img), .air file, .warp files and .vector
files that need to be byte swapped because they were generated on a
different machine. If your machine does not conform to the IEEE Standard
for Binary Floating PointArithmetic (ISO/IEEE Std 754-1985), you should
set this value to zero because conformance with this standard is assumed
when byte swapping. For the same reason, only data generated by machines
that conform to this standard can be properly byte swapped for use by
AIR. 

#define AIR_CONFIG_OUTBITS 16 

The only supported values are 8 and
16. If you choose 8, data will be represented internally and saved as 8
bits/pixel. If you choose 16, data will be represented internally and
saved as 16 bits/pixel. (Either way, you will be able to read in 8 or 16
bit data, this variable only controls output data). If you are not sure
what to do here, the issue of 8 and 16 bit data is discussed elsewhere
at length. 

#define AIR_CONFIG_REP16 3 

This variable is irrelevant if you
have OUTBITS set to 8. The acceptable values are 1, 2 and 3. The
variable controls the format of 16 bit data saved to disk by the AIR
package. If you are not sure what to do here, the issue of 16 bit data
types is discussed elsewhere at length. 

#define AIR_CONFIG_THRESHOLD1 7000 
#define AIR_CONFIG_THRESHOLD2 7000 

AIR_CONFIG_THRESHOLD1 and AIR_CONFIG_THRESHOLD2 control the default
pixel value thresholds used by the registration programs. If you have
set AIR_CONFIG_OUTBITS to 8, only the first set of thresholds is used.
If you have set AIR_CONFIG_OUTBITS to 16, only the second set is used.
The thresholds should be values that will typically separate brain
(suprathreshold) from nonbrain (subthreshold). The values used in the
AIR distribution are not particularly likely to be useful in your
laboratory. Look at some data to make a reasonable guess, and bear in
mind that these thresholds are easily overridden on a per use basis. 

#define AIR_CONFIG_VERBOSITY 0 

If non-zero, this allows some non-essential information to be printed
to the screen when AIR programs are run #define AIR_CONFIG_PIX_SIZE_ERR
.0001 The variable decides how fussy the AIR package is about deciding
that pixel sizes are identical. If you plan to round off pixel sizes
only to the nearest .1 mm (not recommended), you need to make this
value .1. If you like to type everything out to 15 decimal places, you
can make the AIR package equally compulsive.

The following lines may already appear in config.h as generated by
./configure or as copied from config_PC.h. Adding them (if not already
present) or altering their pre-existing values could render AIR
uncompilable on your machine, so make changes with caution and make
back up copies first

#define AIR_CONFIG_REQ_PERMS 0 

This controls whether AIR uses two C functions that are not part of the
ANSI C standard, but that provide useful functionality if available.
The non-ANSI functions stat() and lstat() make it possible to access
UNIX file permissions. By using these functions, AIR can inform a user
of specific reasons that a program failed (e.g., that the user lack
write permission in the directory where data is supposed to be saved).
Some non-UNIX C compilers also implement stat() and/or lstat() (even
though the underlying operating system may not support all of the
informative functionality). If stat() and/or lstat() are available, it
is recommended that you use them. However, if they are not available,
compilation will probably fail unless you set this value to 0. Possible
configuration values are: *	0. AIR makes not use of stat() or
lstat(). *	1. AIR will use stat(), but not lstat(). *	2. stat()
and lstat() will be used.


#define AIR_CONFIG_PIPES 0 

This controls whether AIR will use a non-ANSI C function needed for
safe on-the-fly decompression of image files. If non-zero, AIR will use
the function popen() to pipe data from a decompression program into
AIR. If your compiler does not support popen, you should set this value
to zero. If this value is zero, you do not need to worry about
AIR_CONFIG_DECOMPRESS, AIR_CONFIG_COMPRESSED_SUFFIX or
AIR_CONFIG_DECOMPRESS_COMMAND because they have no effect in the
absence of popen(). 

#define AIR_CONFIG_DECOMPRESS 0 

This parameter is only relevant if AIR_CONFIG_PIPES is non-zero. If
this value is set to zero, code to decompress images on-the-fly is
disabled. 


#define AIR_CONFIG_COMPRESSED_SUFFIX ".gz" 

This parameter is only relevant if AIR_CONFIG_PIPES and
AIR_CONFIG_DECOMPRESS are both non-zero. This suffix identifies
compressed header or image files. For example, if the value is ".gz",
files ending with .hdr.gz will be recognized by AIR as compressed
header files and files ending with .img.gz will be recognized as
compressed image files. If you use the UNIX compress routine, you would
need to change the suffix to ".Z".


#define AIR_CONFIG_DECOMPRESS_COMMAND "gunzip -c " 

This parameter is only relevant if AIR_CONFIG_PIPES and
AIR_CONFIG_DECOMPRESS are both non-zero. This must identify a command
that is able to decompress files ending with
AIR_CONFIG_COMPRESSED_SUFFIX when followed by a file name ending in
this suffix. In addition, the command must output to a pipe. If the
decompression program is not on a user's search path, AIR may fail to
find the command. In this case, you can give a fully qualified path for
the decompression program (e.g., "/usr/local/bin/gunzip -c "). Note
that a trailing space after the command is required.
