test-fftn.c	- test suggested easy routine
test-all.c	- test float/double, interleaved storage (complex)

Edit the Makefile to reflect your complier and then `make`.


You may have to define SUN_BROKEN_REALLOC if your realloc() function
doesn't accept a NULL pointer.

If you need to save space:
 - define FFT_NOFLOAT or FFT_NODOUBLE to avoid compiling that precision.
 - define FFT_RADIX4 if you only want radix 2, radix 4 transforms

The file test-all.c also demonstrates other options to try, check the source
code to see what compiler defines to use.
