.TH tal_CDA Brainvox
.SH NAME
tal_CDA \- performs change distribution analysis on image volumes.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_CDA [options] inputtemp outputfile 
.SH DESCRIPTION
This  program reads the volume specified by the input template and
performs change distribution analysis.  It first detects local maxs and
mins based on the neighborhood selected by the '-r' option and the
step sizes.  It then checks for kurtosis in the resulting distribution (gamma2)
and reports the points whose are significant by the gamma1 test.
The output includes the location of each local max and min
weighted by their neighborhood, the z scores and Talairach space location
of the points.  The output is sent to the specified file or to stdout if "-" is
specified as an output file.
.PP
Options:
.TP
-x(dx)
The x axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-y(dy)
The y axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-z(dz)
The image depth in bytes.  The default is 2 bytes (unsigned shorts).
.TP
-s(ddx)
The stepping size in the x axis.  The default is 2 pixels.
.TP
-t(ddy)
The stepping size in the y axis.  The default is 2 pixels.
.TP
-u(ddz)
The stepping size in the z axis.  The default is 2 pixels.
.TP
-v
The entire volume of data is to be analyzed.  The default is to restrict
analysis to Talairach space.
.TP
-g
Uses an iterative computation of gamma1 and gamma2 which removes one
local max/min for each pass until significance of the gamma statistics
is lowered.
.TP
-verbose
Reports to stderr information regarding each pass when using the -g option.
.TP
-o(offset)
16 bit data offset.  All 16 bit data have this offset value added before
the data is used.  The default is -256.
.TP
-d(stddev)
This selects the z score value above which points are considered significant.
The default is 2.575.
.TP
-ties(max_ties)
Due to smoothing, a local max/min value may occur multiple times in the
local search area.  Up to this proportion of multiple values are allowed
before the point is rejected as a local min/max.  The default is 0.25. 
.TP
-n(num)
Number of patient volumes summed to make the input volume.  The default
is 1.
.TP
-f(start)
This specifies the slice number for the first image in the volume.  Default:1.
.TP
-l(end)
This specifies the slice number for the last image in the volume.  Default:15.
.TP
-i(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one slice to the next.  Default:1.
.TP
-b
This specifies that 16bit images should be byte swapped before using.
.TP
-r(dx[:dy:dz])
This specifies the radius (in terms of number of stepping sizes in each
dimension) within which a point must be a local min/max to be considered.
If only DX is specified, it is assumed that DY and DZ are the same as DX.
Individual values may be specified for all axis by separating the numbers
by colons (:).  The default is: 2:2:2.
.TP
-thres(V)
In this mode, the gamma statistics are ignored, and all points with z scores
(absolute values) over V are output.
.TP
-m(masktemp)
This option allows the user to specify an 8bit mask volume.  Only voxels for
which the entire sphere of the search area (-r) is within the mask are
considered as possible mins or maxs.
