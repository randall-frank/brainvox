.TH tal_skel Brainvox
.SH NAME
tal_skel \- Computes the skeleton of an input volume.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_skel [options] inputtemp outputtemp
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program performs a skeletonization operation on objects in the input volume.
The operation reduces an object to its underlying skeleton by selectively removing
voxels from the object until a single voxel thick skeleton remains.  The output volume
pixel values are the number of voxels in the neighborhood of a voxel.  The value one
occurs for an isolated voxel.  Two occurs at the terminus of a skeleton.  Three occurs
throughout the length of the skeleton (the voxel itself plus one incoming and one
outgoing voxel).  Output voxels with values of four or more occur at branching points.
The objects within a volume are selected by simple thresholding.  Voxels greater than the
threshold are considered to be part of the objects.  The operation can be performed in 3D,
or as a series of 2D planar operations.
.PP
INPUTTEMP is the input volume template.  OUTPUTTEMP is the output
volume template.  The output volume is an 8bit volume.
.PP
Options:
.TP
-x(dx)
The x axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-y(dy)
The y axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-z(dz)
The image depth in bytes.  The default is 2 bytes (unsigned shorts).
.TP
-o(offset)
16 bit data offset.  All pixels have this offset value added before
they is used.  The default is 0.
.TP
-f(start)
This specifies the slice number for the first image in the volume.  Default:1.
.TP
-l(end)
This specifies the slice number for the last image in the volume.  Default:119.
.TP
-i(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one slice to the next.  Default:1.
.TP
-b
This specifies that 16bit images should be byte swapped before using.
.TP
-t(thres)
This specifies a threshold value.  Voxels above this value are considered
to be part of the object.  If the threshold value is negative, voxels which
are below the negative of the threshold value will be considered part of
the object (allowing for inverse thresholding). The default value:100
.TP
-2d
This option specifies that the program is to perform plane by plane a 2d
version of the operation.  The default:full 3d operation.
.TP
-h(histfile)
This option specifies that a histogram of the skeleton volume is to be written
to the specified file.  By default, histograms are not saved.
