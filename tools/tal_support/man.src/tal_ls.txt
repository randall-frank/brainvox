       This program can be used to display the status of any net­
       work/shared  memory  volume  server.  Currently, Brainvox,
       Voxblast and tal_mkshm/tal_rmshm are  the  only  supported
       servers.   The  program  will collect and display the size
       and nature of the volumes that each copy of Brainvox  run­
       ning  on  the  current machine has loaded and will display
       the same information for any default Voxblast  serevrs  as
       well.   For  shared memory volume created using tal_mkshm,
       the volume template and the size of the shared memory vol­
       ume  in  bytes  is  displayed.   The user may restrict the
       search (asking for info on a specific server) via  command
       line options.

       Options:

       ‐n(n)  Search  a  single  invocation of Brainvox. N is the
              order in which the Brainvox copies  were  launched,
              starting  at  0.  The default is to search all run­
              ning invocations.

       ‐h(host)
              This selects a specific hostname (TCP/IP) to search
              for a Voxblast server.  The default is:localhost.

       ‐p(port)
              This selects a specific port (TCP/IP) to search for
              a Voxblast server.  The default is:‐1.

       ‐s(volnum)
              This selects a specific shared memory volume number
              to check the size of.  The default is to search for
              all shared memory volumes.
