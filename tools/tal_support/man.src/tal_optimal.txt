       This program uses multi‐dimensional dynamic programming to
       determine  the optimal 2 1/2 dimensional surface through a
       volumetric cost function.  The input is  a  cost  function
       c=f(x,y,z)  and  the output is an image z=g(x,y).  The sum
       of f(x,y,g(x,y)) is minimized subject to  the  constraints
       that |g(x,y)‐g(x+1,y)| <= conn[x] and |g(x,y)‐g(x,y+1)| <=
       conn[y].  The algorithm is very fast and (provided that  a
       temporary  accumulator  does  not  overflow) exact.  Range
       sets the connectivity (surface smoothness) rules  and  can
       be  set  by the user.  In addition, one axis may be speci­
       fied  as  a  "wrap‐around"  axis.   If  such  an  axis  is
       selected, the solution at either end of the axis must also
       satisfy the connectivity constraints.

       INPUTTEMP is the input volume template.  The input  volume
       is a floating point volume.  OUTPUTIMG is the output image
       filename.  The output image is in 16bit format.

       Options:

       ‐x(dx) The x axis  size  of  the  image  in  pixels.   The
              default is 256 pixels.

       ‐y(dy) The  y  axis  size  of  the  image  in pixels.  The
              default is 256 pixels.

       ‐f(start)
              This specifies the slice number for the first image
              in the volume.  Default:1.

       ‐l(end)
              This  specifies the slice number for the last image
              in the volume.  Default:20.

       ‐i(step)
              This specifies the increment number to go from  one
              slice to the next.  Default:1.

       ‐b     This  specifies  that  16bit  images should be byte
              swapped before using.

       ‐c(x:y)
              This option specifies the connectivity rules to use
              in the x and y axis.  Default:1:1.

       ‐w(wrap)
              This  option selects the x or y axis (0 or 1) to be
              considered circular.  The default:no wrapping.

       ‐v     This option enables verbose mode.  Default: silent.
