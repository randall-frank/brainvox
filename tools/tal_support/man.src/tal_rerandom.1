.TH tal_rerandom Brainvox
.SH NAME
tal_rerandom \- Computes a t map threshold for a series of volumes using a non-parametric re-randomization technique.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_rerandom [options] n_subjects [-|vol1temp ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program takes a number of volumes specified on the command line by
N_SUBJECTS.  It assumes that these volumes are differences between two
other volumes.  If the two original volumes are given the labels A and B then
the input volumes can be assumed to be A-B.  This package computes T score 
maps for all combinations of N_SUBJECTS/2 being relabeled B-A. A distribution
of maximum T values for all such re-randomizations is computed.  The
significance of the original labeling is taken to be proportional to the
location of its Tmax value in the distribution.  The original T map can
be thresholded at a level determined by the Tmax distribution.  The program
can output the correct T map volume as well as the Tmax distribution.
.PP
Filename templates of all the input volumes are specified on the command line.
If a "-" is used for the input volume template, the input volume template names
are read from stdin.  A volume mask may be used to restrict the operation to a
portion of the volume.  By default the program will attempt to compute all
the possible rerandomizations.  The user may specify a maximum number of 
rerandomizations to compute.  If this number is exceeded, the program will 
sample the rerandomization distribution (with replacement) instead of computing
all the possible cases.  In the case of an odd number of subjects, 
rerandomizations will be computed for n choose (n/2) and (n/2)+1. For n=7,
the complete 7C3 and 7C4 pools will be computed.  In case of sampling with
an odd number of subjects, the 7C3 pool or 7C4 pool is selected at random for
each trial.
.PP
Because of the extremely long computational times this program requires,
a simple checkpointing mechinism has been implemented which allows the program
to be stopped and restarted where it left off at a later time.  See the "-R"
option.
.PP
The program also supports the computation of histograms from the Tmax values of
the re-randomization distribution.  The histogram range and bucketsize, as
well as the handling
of outliers, can be specified on the command line.  The histogram is written
to disk as an ASCII text file with each line specifying the center of a bucket
and the number of pixels which fell into the bucket.
.PP
Options:
.TP
-x(dx)
The x axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-y(dy)
The y axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-z(dz)
The image depth in bytes.  All input volume must have the same depth.
The default is 4 bytes (floats).
.TP
-f(start)
This specifies the slice number for the first image in the volume.  Default:1.
.TP
-l(end)
This specifies the slice number for the last image in the volume.  Default:119.
.TP
-i(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one slice to the next.  
Default:1.
.TP
-s(seed)
This specifies the seed for the random number generator used when in 
sampling mode.  It can be used to help reproduce "random" results.
Default:1.
.TP
-R(basename)
This option specifies that the checkpointing mechinism is to be enabled using
the base filename BASENAME.  If a file by the name "basename".kill is created
in the working directory of this program, the program will write its current
state to the file "basename".restart_data and write a simple shell script to
the file "basename".restart.  To continue the computation where it left off,
run the script file "basename".restart.  Do NOT delete the file "basename".kill
as the program will do this automatically and uses it to determine if the
file "basename".restart_data is to be read.  Default:none
.TP
-b
This specifies that 16bit images should be byte swapped before using.  Default: no
swapping.
.TP
-v[v[v[v]]]
This option specifies a verbosity level (number of v's).
.TP
-o(offset)
This option specifies an offset value added to each pixel before it is used. The default:0
.TP
-M(maxtrials)
This option allows the user to set a maximum number of rerandomizations to
attempt.  If the number of rerandomizations exceeds this number, the program
will switch into a sampling mode and generate MAXTRIALS rerandomizations at
random choosing them with replacement.  The default:1000
.TP
-Hfile(histofile)
This option specifies a file to save a Tmax histogram into.
The default:no histogram is saved.
.TP
-Hmin(minval)
This option specifies the value of the center of the first histogram bucket.
The default:0.0.  Note that the first bucket extends from this value plus
and minus one-half of the bucketsize.
.TP
-Hmax(maxval)
This option specifies the value of the center of the last histogram bucket.
The default:255.0.  Note that the last bucket extends from this value plus
and minus one-half of the bucketsize.
.TP
-Hsize(binsize)
This option specifies the width of a histogram bucket.  The default:1.0.
.TP
-Hkeep
This option specifies that pixels values which do not fall into the range
from min to max are to be mapped into the closest bucket.  By default
pixel values outside the min-max range are not counted.
.TP
-V(outvoltemplate)
This option specifies the name of a volume to be saved containing the Tmap
for the "proper" remapping.  This should be thresholded using information in
the file output by the -Otmax option. The volume is a floating point volume.
Default: do not save.
.TP
-W(outvoltemplate)
This option specifies the name of a volume to be saved containing the
smoothed variance map for the "proper" remapping.
The volume is a floating point volume.
Default: do not save.
.TP
-Oabs
Specifies that the comparison for declaring a Tmax value to be greater than
another should be performed on absolute values.  Default: use signed values
.TP
-Otmax(file)
This option specifies the name of a file which includes a list of all
Tmax values for every re-randomization.  The list contains columns 
sorted by iteration and by T value and includes a column of the rank of
each observation.  This file is updated after each iteration. 
Default: do not save.
.TP
-Ostats(file)
This option specifies the name of a file which will contain some extra 
information regarding the number of iterations and the rank of the 
proper labeling.  Default: stdout.
.TP
-m(masktemp)
This option allows the user to specify a filename template for a mask
volume.  Statistics are only computed for voxels withing this volume.  The
default is to compute for all voxels.
.TP
-k(kernalfile)
This option specifies a filename of a kernal to be used for smoothing the
variance locally before the T value is computed.  Default: no smoothing is
used.
.PP
The ASCII kernal file has the following format:
.PP
Xsize Ysize Zsize
.PP
Followed by Zsize 2D matrices of the following format:
.PP
v11 v21 v31 ... vXsize1
.PP
v12 v22 v32 ... vXsize2
.PP
v13 v23 v33 ... vXsize2
.PP
...
.PP
v1Ysize v2Ysize v3Ysize ... vXsizeYsize
.PP
A total of (Xsize*Ysize*Zsize) values follow the three value header line.
These values specify what voxels around each voxel are to be used in the
computation of local statistics.  A value of 0 in the kernal signifies that
a particular voxel is not to be used. 
The relative weight of each voxel used in the smoothing function
is given by the kernal.  For even weighting, only the values 0 and 1 should be
used in the kernal.

.SH NOTES
Input difference images are converted to a 16bit fixed point format
internally (1+6.9).  This means that the input data can only range from
+64 to -64 and are brought into the computation with a resolution of
0.00195 (1/512) units.  This greatly reduces the program's memory usage 
at the expense of some dynamic range and resolution.  All computations
using this fixed point data (Sums,Sum of Squares,Variances,
Variance smoothing, and T scores) are done at full floating point resolution.
.PP
In the current smoothing implementation, a strip around the border of each
image (xy plane only) the same width as the radius of the smoothing kernal
is not smoothed.  It is assumed that useful data is not located within this
band.  If a single point kernal is used, the strip has no width, but no
smoothing is performed either.
.PP
This program is based on ideas and methodology presented in:
Holmes AP, Blair RC, Watson JDG, Ford I; Non-Parametric Analysis Of Statistic
Images from Functional Mapping Experiments. JCBFM (in press)
.PP
Currently, only 8bit mask volume are supported.
