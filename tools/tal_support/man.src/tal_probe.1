.TH tal_probe Brainvox
.SH NAME
tal_probe \- Returns information about voxels at a point in a volume.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_probe [options] inputtemp
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program takes as input a list of Talairach space coordinates and a voxel volume.
The list of points is used to probe the volume for the values of voxels around each of
the points.
.PP
INPUTTEMP is the input volume template.  The input volume is assumed to be in
Talairach space.  Tal_probe expects on standard input a
series of ASCII Talairach space locations of the form (score is ignored):
.PP
xxx yyy zzz score
.PP
Output is ASCII test to standard output.  It includes the mean, min and maximum 
voxel values within the specified radius around each probe point.
In the case of the total option '-t' the average probe location is output.
The program will stop when the end of standard input is reached.
.PP
Options:
.TP
-x(dx)
The x axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-y(dy)
The y axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-z(dz)
The image depth in bytes.  The default is 2 bytes (unsigned shorts).
.TP
-o(offset)
16 bit data offset.  All 16 bit data have this offset value added before
the data is used.  The default is 0.
.TP
-f(start)
This specifies the slice number for the first image in the volume.  Default:1.
.TP
-l(end)
This specifies the slice number for the last image in the volume.  Default:119.
.TP
-i(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one slice to the next.  Default:1.
.TP
-b
This specifies that 16bit images should be byte swapped before using.
.TP
-r(radius)
This allows the user to specify the radius of voxels around the probe
points to be analyzed. Default radius:3 voxels.
.TP
-t
This option computes only total stats for all points input.
.TP
-m(masktemp)
This option selects a filename template for a mask volume.  If a mask volume 
is specified, only those voxels within the mask volume are considered to be
within the specified radius (mask voxel > 0).  The default: no masking
is performed.
