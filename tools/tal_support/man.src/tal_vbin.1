.TH tal_vbin Brainvox
.SH NAME
tal_vbin \- Performs basic image file viewing operations.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_vbin [options] binfile [xsize ysize [palettefile]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads a binary file and views it using an GLUT/OpenGL based
viewer.  The program can guess the image size, read compressed files, and
apply a palette to the image.  Support for 8, 16 and floating point formats
is included.  The palette file is a 768 byte file in the form: [RRR... GGG...
BBB...].   BINFILE is the input binary filename.  All GLUT command line
parameters are allowed as well.  The display can be resized, and the image
will be stretched to fit.  The display can also by quit by pressing the
'ESC' key.  If no size is given, the program selects the size by taking the
uncompressed file size in bytes, removing the header, dividing by the size
of a pixel in bytes, and taking the square root, assuming the image to be 
square.

Note: unlike the rest of the tal_programs, options and their values are space
separated in this program.
.PP
Options:
.TP
-pid
By default, the program will remain connected to the cmdline.  With this option
the program is disassociated from the command line and the process id of the
display invoked is printed on stdout.
.TP
-head h
This specifies the number of (uncompressed) bytes to skip before treating
the rest of the file as an image. Default:0.
.TP
-pos x y
This requests that the display be placed at the location x,y on the screen. 
Default: none.
.TP
-z1|-8
This specifies that the file is to be interpreted as unsigned byte pixels.
Default: this is the default.
.TP
-z2|-16
This specifies that the file is to be interpreted as unsigned short pixels.
By default pixels in this mode are automatically scaled (min,max) to (0,255) 
for display.
.TP
-z3|-24
This specifies that the file is to be interpreted as an RGB image with
unsigned char components (RGBRGBRGB...).
.TP
-z4|-float
This specifies that the file is to be interpreted as IEEE floating point pixels.
By default pixels in this mode are automatically scaled (min,max) to (0,255) 
for display.
.TP
-max max
This specifies the maximum pixel value for 16bit and float scaling.
Default: the largest pixel value in the image.
.TP
-min min
This specifies the minimum pixel value for 16bit and float scaling.
Default: the smallest pixel value in the image.
.TP
-swap
This forces byte swapping for 16bit and floating images.
Byte swapping is only supported for 16bit images.  By default, the program
attempts to guess the proper byte swapping.
.TP
-noswap
This disables byte swapping for 16bit and floating images.
Byte swapping is only supported for 16bit images.  By default, the program
attempts to guess the proper byte swapping.
.TP
-noflip
This disables vertical image flipping.  The default is to flip the 
image vertically.
.TP
-pal palfile
This specifies the name of a palette file to be used to colorize the image.
It is not used in -z3 mode.
.TP
-wait
This specifies the program should run the the foreground and not spawn off
an independant child process.  It "waits" for the program to be exited.

.SH NOTES
Byte swapping is only supported for 16bit images.
