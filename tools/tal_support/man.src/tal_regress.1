.TH tal_regress Brainvox
.SH NAME
tal_regress \- Performs linear regression pixelwise or pooled across many 
input volumes.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_regress [options] datafile
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads an ASCII format DATAFILE containing a description of a
multiple regression operation in the language syntax described below.  The
program performs the requested regression at each pixel in the input data
volumes.  Each input data volume provides a single pixel value for each
regression (unless the SINGLE_FIT option is used, in which case individual
pixel observations are collapsed into a single regression).  A number of
output regression statistics can be
selected and these are output as floating point volumes.  The program
supports continuous and discrete valued data.  Discrete valued data
(CLASS data) is handled though the use of dummy variables which are not
visible to the user.  Tal_regress uses enough memory
to hold a single slice of every input volume for all observations and
every output volume specified at the natural volume pixel depth plus memory
for a single regression (one vector and a matrix).
.PP
The datafile regression description consists of three sections. 
Each section is begun by a keyword.
.PP
The first section is the VOLPARAMS section.  This section allows the user
to specify the types and sizes of the input volumes as well as an optional
8bit mask volume.  Parameters regarding the computation of ANCOVA adjusted
output values and an optional input log transform are also set in this section.
The SINGLE_FIT parameter can be set to select a single regression over all
pixels (each pixel is a single observation) instead of performing many
regressions, one at each pixel.   The _PREFIX parameters allow for a base
directory specification for both input and output files (which is not
used with the '=', '-' and shared memory filespecs).
.PP
The second section is the MODEL section which describes the data model to
be used in the regressions.  Regressions are specified in the form: 
Y=A0+A1X1+A2X2...  The first line in this section must describe the Y value
for the regression.  The Y values can have either be provided by a volume, 
specified by a name and the depth of the volume in bytes or a single value
for each observation.  In this latter case the Y_CONST form is used which
does not require a volume depth.
If a constant is to be allowed in the regression, the next
line should contain the CONST keyword.  The remainder of this section may be
filled with X variables.  These come in four flavors.  The first is a
COVARIABLE_VOL, which is a volume containing a separate value
for this variable for each pixel in the volume (this variable requires a
name, a mean value for ANCOVA adjusted Y value output and the volume depth
in bytes).  The second  is a COVARIABLE_CONST, which is a single value for this
variable for all pixels in the volume (this variable requires a name and a
mean value for ANCOVA adjusted Y value output).  The third variable type is
a CLASS variable.  This
variable is level valued (MALE,FEMALE or HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW) such as a classical
ANOVA (only the name of this class needs to be specified in this section).
The fourth variable type is LABELCLASS.  This variable is NOT included in the
regression, rather it is a level valued variable (like the CLASS variable)
which can be used to enhance output volume selection.  Since it is not used
in the regression, no SS_VARIABLE or P_SS_VARIABLE can be output for a
LABELCLASS variable.  ADJ_Y_CLASS_MEAN (adjusted for the other regression
variables) can be output for a LABELCLASS variable.
.PP
The third section is the OUTPUT section which describes which statistical
volumes are to be written out with the results of the regressions.  Various
values from each regression can be saved into floating point output volumes.
Most output volumes are selected by a keyword and a volume template name. 
SS_ERROR saves the sum of squares (SS) remaining after the regression. 
SS_VARIABLE requires the name of a X variable of any type and saves the
sequential SS attributed to that variable.  P_SS_VARIABLE requires the name
of a X variable of any type and saves the partial SS attributed to that
variable in the presence of all other variables in the model.  SS_TOTAL
saves the total SS for each regression.  SS_MODEL saves SS_TOTAL - SS_ERROR.
ADJ_Y_MEAN adjusts each Y value by normalizing each X variable (to the mean
value specified in the MODEL section or to the first level of each CLASS
variable).  The adjusted Y values are saved.  ADJ_Y_CLASS_MEAN outputs the
mean adjusted Y value for a specific classname and classlevel. 
COVARIABLE_SLOPE saves the regression coefficient for any X covariable
specified by name.
COVARIABLE_STD_ERROR saves the coefficient standard error for any X covariable
specified by name.
R2_MODEL outputs the R squared value for the regression (1-SSE/SST).
R2_ADJ_MODEL outputs the adjusted R squared value (1-(SSE/(n-p))/(SST/(n-1))).
SS_PRESS outputs the prediction sum of squares error (PRESS).
R2_PRED_MODEL outputs the prediction R squared value (1-PRESS/SST).
Currently, outputs which require the computation of the HAT matrix diagonal 
(such as PRESS_MODEL and R2_PRED_MODEL)
can not be computed if the SINGLE_FIT option is specified unless the size
of the data volumes is one voxel.
Note, if the SINGLE_FIT parameter is specified, no
output files will be written (the output templates are ignored), instead,
the requested results will be sent in tab form to stdout as there will only
be a single value for each requested result (only one regression is
performed).
.PP
The fourth section is the OBSERVATIONS section which describes the actual input
observation.  There is one line in the file for each line in the MODEL
description for each observation.  The lines are different for each variable
type and do not contain any keywords.  For a Y variable, only a
volume template is needed.  For a Y_CONST a single value is specified.
For CONST, the value 1.0 should be specified.  For
COVARIABLE_VOL, a volume template is specified.  For COVARIABLE_CONST,
a single value is specified.  For a CLASS or LABELCLASS variable, the name
of the level for this observation is specified.
.PP
The regression definition datafile is terminated by the END keyword.
.PP
Options:
.TP
-v[v[v[v]]]
This option selects the verbosity level.  Each additional character adds to the verbosity
level.  Levels above 3 are useful only for debugging.

.SH NOTES
This program is based on information in the SAS programming manual and the
following paper:

The program also makes use of Applied Statistics algorithm 274 (AS274) for
the actual regression.  This is an extension of Morven Gentleman's AS75 
routines by Alan Miller (Applied Statistics 41/1992).
