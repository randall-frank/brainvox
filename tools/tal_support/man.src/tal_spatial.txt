       This  program reads on standard input a list  of  clusters
       in   the   output  format  of  tal_cluster  (IE  x,y,z,avg
       value,size,serial number,threshold).  For each input clus­
       ter it computes the significance of the cluster taking its
       spatial extent into account.  The output of  this  program
       is a new tab deliminated list with an eighth column added.
       This new column is the probability the cluster appeared by
       chance.   It is assumed that the volume that was clustered
       was a Z map (SPM{z}).

       SIZE is the size of the search volume in voxels.

       FWHM is the smoothness of the search volume.

       DIMENSION   is   the   order   of   the   search    volume
       (1=1D,2=2D,3=3D).
