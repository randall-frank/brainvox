.SH NAME
tal_rename \- Performs batch image file renaming operations.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_rename [options] inputtemp outputtemp
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program applies a UNIX command to a series of filenames generated from
a pair of filename templates.  See the 
tal_programs man page for details on filename template formation.  This program
scans through a pair of filename templates, generating a UNIX commandline of
the form "cmd infile outfile" for each pair of filenames.  "cmd" may be any 
UNIX 
command (mv, cp, and rm are all pretty useful).  Note that a filename template
of " " will result in no filename being generated (very useful with rm) and
a template with no number field will return the template without substitution
(e.g. "tal_rename "-cln -s" base dest_%%%.pic" will create a series of
symbolic links from the file "base" to files named by "dest_XXX.pic").  The
output file numbers are the same as the input file numbers by default.  The
user may specify separate starting and step sizes for the output file numbers.
No last output file number is needed (stopping is determined by the input
file numbers).
.PP
INPUTTEMP is the input filename template.  OUTPUTTEMP is the 
filename template.

Warning: try the -t option on your tal_rename commandline BEFORE running it
for real.  A poorly formed tal_rename commandline can really ruin your day!

Options:
.TP
-f(start)
This specifies the file number for the first image in the input template. Default:1.
.TP
-l(end)
This specifies the file number for the last image in the input template. Default:124.
.TP
-i(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one input file to the next. Default:1.
.TP
-F(start)
This specifies the file number for the first image in the output template. 
Default: (same as the input file start value).
.TP
-I(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one output file to the next. 
Default: (same as the input file step value).
.TP
-t
This enables the test mode.  Each command is printed, but no commands are
executed.
.TP
-v
This enables verbose mode, which prints out each command as it is executed.
