.SH NAME
tal_label \- Performs 2D and 3D connected components labeling.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_label [options] inputtemp outputtemp
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program performs connected components labeling of a volume of binary
objects.  The program determines the number of independent objects using
a connectivity rule.  Using the user selected rule, no paths can be traced
between each independently labeled object in the output volume. 
The objects within a volume are selected by simple thresholding.  Voxels 
greater than the threshold are considered to be part of the objects.  A
connectivity analysis is performed and each independent object is given
a unique label in the output volume.  There can be at most 254 objects in
the volume.  These objects are given the labels (voxel values) 2 and higher
(consecutively).  An output voxel value of 0 is the background (non-object
voxels) and an output voxel of 1 is an unclassified voxel (this can only
occur if the number of objects exceeds 254).
The operation can be performed in 3D, or as a series of 2D planar operations.
.PP
INPUTTEMP is the input volume template.  OUTPUTTEMP is the output
volume template.  The output volume is an 8bit volume.
.PP
Options:
.TP
-x(dx)
The x axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-y(dy)
The y axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-z(dz)
The image depth in bytes.  The default is 2 bytes (unsigned shorts).
.TP
-o(offset)
16 bit data offset.  All pixels have this offset value added before
they is used.  The default is 0.
.TP
-f(start)
This specifies the slice number for the first image in the volume.  Default:1.
.TP
-l(end)
This specifies the slice number for the last image in the volume.  Default:119.
.TP
-i(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one slice to the next.  Default:1.
.TP
-b
This specifies that 16bit images should be byte swapped before using.
.TP
-t(thres)
This specifies a threshold value.  Voxels above this value are considered
to be part of the object.  If the threshold value is negative, voxels which
are below the negative of the threshold value will be considered part of
the object (allowing for inverse thresholding). The default value:100
.TP
-c(conn)
This option specifies the connectivity rules to use during the labeling 
operation.  For a 2D operation, 4 or 8 connectivity can be used (default:4).
For a 3D operation, 6, 18, or 26 connectivity can be used (default:6).
.TP
-2d
This option specifies that the program is to perform plane by plane a 2d
version of the operation.  The default:full 3d operation.
.TP
-h(histfile)
This option specifies that a histogram of the skeleton volume is to be written
to the specified file.  By default, histograms are not saved.
