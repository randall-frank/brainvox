.TH tal_remask Brainvox
.SH NAME
tal_remask \- Computes a connected voxel mask.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_remask [options] inputtemp outputtemp
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program computes a mask of an object(s) in the input volume including
any inner holes.  The program actually computes a "non-object" mask by 
performing a flood fill of those voxels below the user supplied threshold 
starting at 0,0,0 in the volume.  The resulting mask is then inverted and
output.  The output volume has the value 255 inside the object and 0 outside.
.PP
The program may be useful in computing a MRI brain mask including the
ventricles which can be classified as non-brain if a strict thresholding
method is used to create a mask.
.PP
INPUTTEMP is the input volume template.  OUTPUTTEMP is the output
volume template. The output volume is always 8bit.

Options:
.TP
-x(dx)
The x axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-y(dy)
The y axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-z(dz)
The image depth in bytes.  The default is 1.
.TP
-f(start)
This specifies the slice number for the first image in the volume.  Default:1.
.TP
-l(end)
This specifies the slice number for the last image in the volume.  Default:119.
.TP
-i(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one slice to the next.  
Default:1.
.TP
-b
This specifies that 16bit images should be byte swapped before using.
.TP
-t(thres)
This specifies a threshold value.  Voxels above this value are considered
to be part of the object.  The default value:1.0

.SH NOTES
There is an internal upper bound on the complexity of the object to be masked.
It should be set high enough for the surface of an MRI brain.
