       This program performs connected components labeling  of  a
       volume of binary objects.  The program determines the num­
       ber of independent  objects  using  a  connectivity  rule.
       Using  the  user  selected  rule,  no  paths can be traced
       between each independently labeled object  in  the  output
       volume.   The objects within a volume are selected by sim­
       ple thresholding.  Voxels greater than the  threshold  are
       considered  to  be  part  of  the objects.  A connectivity
       analysis is performed and each independent object is given
       a unique label in the output volume.  There can be at most
       254 objects in the volume.  These objects  are  given  the
       labels  (voxel  values)  2 and higher (consecutively).  An
       output voxel value of 0 is the background (non‐object vox­
       els)  and  an  output  voxel of 1 is an unclassified voxel
       (this can only occur if  the  number  of  objects  exceeds
       254).   The  operation  can  be  performed  in 3D, or as a
       series of 2D planar operations.

       INPUTTEMP is the input volume template.  OUTPUTTEMP is the
       output volume template.  The output volume is an 8bit vol­
       ume.

       Options:

       ‐x(dx) The x axis  size  of  the  image  in  pixels.   The
              default is 256 pixels.

       ‐y(dy) The  y  axis  size  of  the  image  in pixels.  The
              default is 256 pixels.

       ‐z(dz) The image depth in bytes.  The default is  2  bytes
              (unsigned shorts).

       ‐o(offset)
              16  bit  data  offset.  All pixels have this offset
              value added before they is used.  The default is 0.

       ‐f(start)
              This specifies the slice number for the first image
              in the volume.  Default:1.

       ‐l(end)
              This specifies the slice number for the last  image
              in the volume.  Default:119.

       ‐i(step)
              This  specifies the increment number to go from one
              slice to the next.  Default:1.

       ‐b     This specifies that 16bit  images  should  be  byte
              swapped before using.

       ‐t(thres)
              This  specifies  a  threshold  value.  Voxels above
              this value are considered to be part of the object.
              If  the  threshold  value is negative, voxels which
              are below the negative of the threshold value  will
              be  considered  part  of  the  object (allowing for
              inverse thresholding). The default value:100

       ‐c(conn)
              This option specifies the connectivity rules to use
              during the labeling operation.  For a 2D operation,
              4 or 8 connectivity can be used (default:4).  For a
              3D operation, 6, 18, or 26 connectivity can be used
              (default:6).

       ‐2d    This option specifies that the program is  to  per­
              form  plane by plane a 2d version of the operation.
              The default:full 3d operation.

       ‐h(histfile)
              This option  specifies  that  a  histogram  of  the
              skeleton  volume  is to be written to the specified
              file.  By default, histograms are not saved.
