.SH NAME
tal_edm \- Computes a Euclidean distance map for an input volume.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_edm [options] inputtemp outputtemp
.SH DESCRIPTION
This computes a Euclidean distance map (EDM) for objects in the input volume.  The
value of a voxel in an EDM is equal to the distance from that voxel to the edge of an object
in the volume.  A thresholded EDM can be used to quickly erode a volume.  A thresholded
EDM of the inverse of an input volume can be used to quickly dilate a volume.
The objects within a volume are selected by simple thresholding.  Voxels greater than the
threshold are considered to be part of the objects.  The operation can be performed in 3D,
or as a series of 2D planar operations.
.PP
INPUTTEMP is the input volume template.  OUTPUTTEMP is the output
volume template.  The output volume is an 8bit volume unless the -s option is 
specified, in which case it is 16bit.
.PP
Options:
.TP
-x(dx)
The x axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-y(dy)
The y axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-z(dz)
The image depth in bytes.  The default is 2 bytes (unsigned shorts).
.TP
-o(offset)
16 bit data offset.  All pixels have this offset value added before
they is used.  The default is 0.
.TP
-f(start)
This specifies the slice number for the first image in the volume.  Default:1.
.TP
-l(end)
This specifies the slice number for the last image in the volume.  Default:119.
.TP
-i(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one slice to the next.  Default:1.
.TP
-b
This specifies that 16bit images should be byte swapped before using.
.TP
-t(thres)
This specifies a threshold value.  Voxels above this value are considered
to be part of the object.  If the threshold value is negative, voxels which
are below the negative of the threshold value will be considered part of
the object (allowing for inverse thresholding). The default value:100
.TP
-2d
This option specifies that the program is to perform plane by plane a 2d
version of the operation.  The default:full 3d operation.
.TP
-h(histfile)
This option specifies that a histogram of the EDM volume is to be written
to the specified file.  By default, histograms are not saved.
.TP
-s(scale)
This option specifies an integer scale factor for the EDM volume.  The value
should be between 1 and 256.  The output volume will be 16bits if this option
is used and will have some additional sub-voxel accuracy that is not found
in the unscaled EDM.  The voxel value in the scaled EDM should be divided by
the scale factor to get the true (fractional) EDM value.  The default:8bit
unscaled EDMs.
.TP
-sip(interpixel)
This option allows the user to specify the interpixel spacing.  This can be
used in conjunction with the scaled (-s) option to improve the accuracy of
3D EDMs.  The default:1.0.
.TP
-sis(interslice)
This option allows the user to specify the interslice spacing.  This can be
used in conjunction with the scaled (-s) option to improve the accuracy of
3D EDMs.  The default:1.0.
