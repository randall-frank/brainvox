.TH tal_roi_sample Brainvox
.SH NAME
tal_roi_sample \- Resamples voxel values within a series of ROIs into a text file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tal_roi_sample [options] inputtemp roitemp outfile [pointset, pointset ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads an input volume and a series of ROI files (one ROI may exist
for each image file).  The voxels in each image which fall within
the ROIs are output, minus a constant, as a tab deliminated ASCII text file.  Optionally,
one or more Brainvox 'pointset' files may be specified.  Additional values, one for each
pointset, are placed into the output file.  These additional values are the position along
the line segment specified by the first two coordinates in each pointset file.  
The additional values
are normalized so that the first two coordinates in each pointset file are 1 and -1.  Values
outside this range are possible if pixels exist outside the pointset segment ends.
.PP
INPUTTEMP is the input volume template.  ROITEMP is the 
filename template for the ROIs.  OUTFILE is the name of the file into which the voxel
samples will be written.  An OUTFILE of '-' is standard output.  A number of Brainvox
pointset files may be specified as well.
.PP
Options:
.TP
-x(dx)
The x axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-y(dy)
The y axis size of the image in pixels.  The default is 256 pixels.
.TP
-z(dz)
The image depth in bytes.  The default is 2 bytes (unsigned shorts).
.TP
-c(const)
16 bit data offset.  All 16 bit data have this offset value added before
the data is used.  The default is -256.
.TP
-f(start)
This specifies the slice number for the first image in the volume.  Default:1.
.TP
-l(end)
This specifies the slice number for the last image in the volume.  Default:15.
.TP
-i(step)
This specifies the increment number to go from one slice to the next.  Default:1.
.TP
-b
This specifies that 16bit images should be byte swapped before using.
.TP
-k(xystep)
This specifies the pixel step size in xy plane.  The default is
to sample every other pixel in the xy plane the value is:2.
.TP
-p(interpixel)
This option specifies the interpixel spacing in mm.  The default:1.0
.TP
-s(interslice)
This option specifies the interslice spacing in mm.  The default:6.64
.TP
-r(scale)
This option specifies the ROI scaling factor.  The ROI is scaled by
this value before being applied to the image.  The default is set
for use with standard Brainvox ROIs and is:0.5.
.TP
-v
This option enables verbose mode.  The default:quiet mode
