       This program reads a polygon file (in tal_  Geomview  for­
       mat) and will reduce the number of polygons in the surface
       by removing verticies of polygons which are nearly  copla­
       nar  and  representing  the  patch with 2 fewer triangles.
       The inputfile and outputfile (or ’‐’ for stdin/stdout) are
       in  Wavefront OBJ format and consists of a single triangle
       mesh.  The files must have the  "#  TAL_PROGRAMS  Geomview
       file 1.0" header comment as well.

       It is not always possible for this algorithm to succeed as
       it will not remove verticies which are part  of  an  outer
       boundary.   In  such  cases,  as  many verticies as can be
       removed are.

       Options:

       ‐t(thin)
              This option specifies the fraction of the verticies
              to  remove  (0.0  to  1.0).  The default is 0.0 (no
              thinning).

       ‐g     Use the Geomview NOFF file  format  for  input  and
              output.
