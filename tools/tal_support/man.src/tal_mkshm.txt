       This  program  is  used  to  create shared memory volumes.
       Shared memory volumes  are  simply  shared  memory  blocks
       which can be used to store images.  The shared memory vol­
       ume has a filename template in the form  ’:XX_%%%’,  where
       XX  is  the  shared  memory  volume number (start at 0 and
       increment to 99).  NSLICES specifies the number of  slices
       to  be allocated.  The size of each slice is specified via
       the options.  Enough memory is allocated to hold  all  the
       images.   Note:  the  shared memory system does nothing to
       enforce the use of a shared memory volume.  It only checks
       to  make sure the image selected to read/write will fit in
       the  volume.    This   means   that   programs   can   mix
       float/short/byte  access  to the same volume if the slices
       fit.  Care must be taken by the user to ensure  consistant
       use  of  the memory.  The shared memory is not initialized
       to any value on  creation.   Finally,  the  shared  memory
       blocks  must  be explicitly destroyed using tal_rmshm.  If
       not, they will live beyond the current Unix login.   These
       volumes  are extremely useful for the storage of temporary
       results between tal programs.   The  program  outputs  the
       shared memory filename template to stdout.

       Options:

       ‐x(dx) The  x  axis  size  of  the  image  in pixels.  The
              default is 256 pixels.

       ‐y(dy) The y axis  size  of  the  image  in  pixels.   The
              default is 256 pixels.

       ‐z(dz) The image depth in bytes.  The default is 1 byte.
