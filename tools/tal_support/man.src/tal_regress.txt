       This program reads an ASCII format DATAFILE  containing  a
       description of a multiple regression operation in the lan­
       guage syntax described below.  The  program  performs  the
       requested  regression at each pixel in the input data vol­
       umes.  Each input data  volume  provides  a  single  pixel
       value for each regression (unless the SINGLE_FIT option is
       used, in which case individual pixel observations are col­
       lapsed  into  a  single  regression).   A number of output
       regression statistics can be selected and these are output
       as  floating point volumes.  The program supports continu­
       ous and discrete valued data.  Discrete valued data (CLASS
       data)  is  handled though the use of dummy variables which
       are not visible to the user.  Tal_regress uses enough mem­
       ory  to  hold a single slice of every input volume for all
       observations and every output volume specified at the nat­
       ural  volume  pixel depth plus memory for a single regres­
       sion (one vector and a matrix).

       The datafile regression description consists of three sec­
       tions.  Each section is begun by a keyword.

       The  first section is the VOLPARAMS section.  This section
       allows the user to specify the  types  and  sizes  of  the
       input  volumes  as  well  as an optional 8bit mask volume.
       Parameters regarding the computation  of  ANCOVA  adjusted
       output values and an optional input log transform are also
       set in this section.  The SINGLE_FIT parameter can be  set
       to  select a single regression over all pixels (each pixel
       is  a  single  observation)  instead  of  performing  many
       regressions,  one  at each pixel.   The _PREFIX parameters
       allow for a base directory specification  for  both  input
       and  output files (which is not used with the ’=’, ’‐’ and
       shared memory filespecs).

       The second section is the MODEL  section  which  describes
       the data model to be used in the regressions.  Regressions
       are specified in the form:  Y=A0+A1X1+A2X2...   The  first
       line  in  this  section  must describe the Y value for the
       regression.  The Y values can have either be provided by a
       volume, specified by a name and the depth of the volume in
       bytes or a single value for  each  observation.   In  this
       latter  case  the  Y_CONST  form  is  used  which does not
       require a volume depth.  If a constant is to be allowed in
       the  regression,  the  next  line should contain the CONST
       keyword.  The remainder of this section may be filled with
       X  variables.  These come in four flavors.  The first is a
       COVARIABLE_VOL, which is a volume  containing  a  separate
       value for this variable for each pixel in the volume (this
       variable requires a name, a mean value for ANCOVA adjusted
       Y value output and the volume depth in bytes).  The second
       is a COVARIABLE_CONST, which is a single  value  for  this
       variable  for  all  pixels  in  the  volume (this variable
       requires a name and a mean value  for  ANCOVA  adjusted  Y
       value  output).   The  third  variable  type  is  a  CLASS
       variable.  This variable is level valued  (MALE,FEMALE  or
       HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW)  such as a classical ANOVA (only the name
       of this class needs to be specified in this section).  The
       fourth  variable type is LABELCLASS.  This variable is NOT
       included in the regression, rather it is  a  level  valued
       variable  (like  the  CLASS variable) which can be used to
       enhance output volume selection.  Since it is not used  in
       the  regression,  no  SS_VARIABLE  or P_SS_VARIABLE can be
       output  for  a  LABELCLASS   variable.    ADJ_Y_CLASS_MEAN
       (adjusted  for the other regression variables) can be out­
       put for a LABELCLASS variable.

       The third section is the OUTPUT  section  which  describes
       which  statistical  volumes are to be written out with the
       results of the  regressions.   Various  values  from  each
       regression  can  be  saved into floating point output vol­
       umes.  Most output volumes are selected by a keyword and a
       volume  template  name.  SS_ERROR saves the sum of squares
       (SS) remaining after the regression.  SS_VARIABLE requires
       the name of a X variable of any type and saves the sequen­
       tial  SS  attributed  to  that  variable.    P_SS_VARIABLE
       requires  the  name  of a X variable of any type and saves
       the partial SS attributed to that variable in the presence
       of  all  other variables in the model.  SS_TOTAL saves the
       total SS for each regression.  SS_MODEL saves  SS_TOTAL  ‐
       SS_ERROR.   ADJ_Y_MEAN adjusts each Y value by normalizing
       each X variable (to the mean value specified in the  MODEL
       section  or  to  the  first level of each CLASS variable).
       The adjusted Y values are saved.  ADJ_Y_CLASS_MEAN outputs
       the  mean  adjusted  Y  value for a specific classname and
       classlevel.  COVARIABLE_SLOPE saves the regression coeffi­
       cient  for  any  X  covariable specified by name.  COVARI­
       ABLE_STD_ERROR saves the coefficient  standard  error  for
       any  X covariable specified by name.  R2_MODEL outputs the
       R  squared   value   for   the   regression   (1‐SSE/SST).
       R2_ADJ_MODEL   outputs   the   adjusted  R  squared  value
       (1‐(SSE/(n‐p))/(SST/(n‐1))).  SS_PRESS outputs the predic­
       tion  sum of squares error (PRESS).  R2_PRED_MODEL outputs
       the prediction R squared value (1‐PRESS/SST).   Currently,
       outputs  which  require  the computation of the HAT matrix
       diagonal (such as PRESS_MODEL and R2_PRED_MODEL)  can  not
       be  computed  if the SINGLE_FIT option is specified unless
       the size of the data volumes is one voxel.  Note,  if  the
       SINGLE_FIT parameter is specified, no output files will be
       written (the output templates are ignored),  instead,  the
       requested  results  will  be sent in tab form to stdout as
       there will only be  a  single  value  for  each  requested
       result (only one regression is performed).

       The  fourth  section  is  the  OBSERVATIONS  section which
       describes the actual input observation.  There is one line
       in  the  file  for  each line in the MODEL description for
       each observation.  The lines are different for each  vari­
       able  type and do not contain any keywords.  For a Y vari­
       able, only a volume template is needed.  For a  Y_CONST  a
       single  value  is  specified.   For  CONST,  the value 1.0
       should be specified.  For COVARIABLE_VOL,  a  volume  tem­
       plate  is specified.  For COVARIABLE_CONST, a single value
       is specified.  For a CLASS  or  LABELCLASS  variable,  the
       name of the level for this observation is specified.

       The  regression  definition  datafile is terminated by the
       END keyword.

       Options:

       ‐v[v[v[v]]]
              This option  selects  the  verbosity  level.   Each
              additional  character  adds to the verbosity level.
              Levels above 3 are useful only for debugging.

       The program also makes use of Applied Statistics algorithm
       274  (AS274) for the actual regression.  This is an exten­
       sion of Morven Gentleman’s AS75 routines  by  Alan  Miller
       (Applied Statistics 41/1992).
